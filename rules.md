# The Game (South American Dutch) 

The game is played with a standard single deck of cards. Exclude the jokers from the deck.

Each player is dealt 4 cards face down in front of them. The rest of the deck in the middle of the table. The objective of the game is to have the lowest
value (as assigned to individual cards) in your hand when the round finishes. You play until someone busts 100.

## Card values

- Red king = -1
- Ace = 1
- Jack = 11
- Queen = 12
- Black king = 13

Rest of them is obvious...

## Dealing

Deal 4 cards to each player face down. Arrange the cards in a square. The rest of the deck place face down in the middle.

At the start of the game each player can look at their top 2 cards of the square *once* and then place them face down again.

## Goal

You want to get the fewest points in your hand over the course of the round and when you *think* you have that, at the start of your turn, you can "knock",
freezing your hand and allowing all other players one more turn after which the round finishes and you reveal your hand and count up the scores.

## A turn

Draw a card from the deck in the middle, do not show anyone. 

- You have the choice of swapping that card with one of the cards in your hand (face down on the table).
After swapping a card you must discard the card you swapped for face up next to the deck in the middle. You cannot look at the card prior to placing it in the middle.
- When a player draws a card from the deck, it may be a card that carries a *special effect*. Cards with special effects only apply if you have drawn the card from the main deck, not your hand.

## Special effects

- 7 or 8: Player can look at an opponents card and swap it with any card in a players hand, that includes other opponents or your own.
- 9 or 10: Player can blindly swap two cards in a players hand.
- Red queen: Player can look at one of their own cards.

## Snapping

This part of the game is really important. 

When a card is placed face up in the discard pile, *any* player can take any matching card on the table (including opponents) and slam it on top of the discard pile.
If you have successfully matched the card, you have now reduced your hand by one card. However, if you made a mistake and the cards don't match, you return the card face down to the original position
and take a new card from the top of the deck and place it face down next your cards in front of you.

You can only snap one card at a time and it is the first place their card face up on the discard pile that wins the race.

*note* this can happen out of turn.

## Scoring

When the round finishes, you go around the table and total up the points in every players hand. If you are the player that knocked, but haven't got the lowest score
you add a further ten points to your score.
